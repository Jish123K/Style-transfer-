# Style-transfer-
Style transfer is a technique that involves taking the style of one image and applying it to the content of another image, resulting in a new image that combines the style of one image with the content of another. This technique has many applications in digital art, design, and photography.

To create a style transfer application, you could use a pretrained deep learning model such as the Neural Style Transfer model. This model is trained on a large dataset of images and is capable of transferring the style of one image to the content of another.

To use the model in your application, you would first allow the user to select two images: one to use as the style image and one to use as the content image. Then, you would pass these images through the pretrained model to generate a new image that combines the style of the style image with the content of the content image.

I can also add additional features to your application, such as the ability to adjust the strength of the style transfer, or the ability to choose from a variety of different style images.
